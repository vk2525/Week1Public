# Medlytics Week 1!
Welcome! This is the repository for all assignments and datasets for Week 1 of the BeaverWorks Medlytics course 2019. 
All the worksheets are empty; we recommend copying the links to each notebook as needed and importing them into your Colaboratory drive.

We will be working with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset this week. There are over 8000 features collected from some 92,000 people, consisting of physical characteristics and survey questions collected every two years.
